# User managing

### The project was made to manage an user api by permitting C.R.U.D operations on it. 
( https://user-managing-api.herokuapp.com/api/users/ or https://github.com/flpfrnc/user_managing_api ) 

<br />

#### The Register is made by 3 steps:
- Registration of an user
- Registration of a profile linked to the user
- Listing of all registrations alongside a 'complete registration' which shows the user with it's profile.
